This was a project to demonstrate skill pretaining to setting up a basic website.
Showcased in the project is:
    -Basic boilerplate for HTML websites
    -Headings and paragraphs
    -Adding page links and image links from folders
    -Ordered and unordered lists
Most of the skills are basic, but I did appriciate learning how to link directly from the working files and directores on the same device. Previously when I would go through HTML courses, while it showed me how to use the anchor and image tags to add the links, it would be hard to practice because I would have to link from a URL directly from the internet. During this project, I was able to link directly from the files I had set up directly on my working device, which helps show me how website are more practically built.
I also put more terminal commands and git commands into practise, such as:
    -Making the folders and files directly from the terminal
    -Using git commands to stage and commit changes in the repository
    -Using VS Code to edit files and using the built in terminal for easier commit messages
Learning how to use the terminal, git, and VS Code helps me visualize and practice language skills practically. Before with previous coding courses, built in tools were used to teach the languages, but learning the languages was the main focus of the course. After it was completed, I knew the skills but didn't know how to apply them. Using the VS Code and git commands seems more real, like how actual programmers make websites and programs. It helps teach how to apply the skills I just learned, and I feel confident that I can play around and make personal project that I can actually look at and make them feel more real.
